PulseGuard — Judge Story 
Problem 
Communities and teams burn out silently, and we only react after people fail or systems break.

What PulseGuard Does
PulseGuard turns low‑cost biosignals into early warnings of human and system strain—before burnout becomes failure.

Why It’s Different
Uses $5–$10 optical pulse sensors — no medical equipment

Ground‑up ML learns a baseline instead of relying on pretrained health models

Predicts future strain and staffing risk, not just current vitals

How It Works
We read pulse signals → clean and extract stress features → Guardian AI learns “healthy operation” → flags Strain Events when risk rises revealed in real time.

Magic Demo Moment 
Stress happens → Guardian AI flags a Strain Event → dashboard predicts staffing risk and recommends intervention.

Who Cares
Underserved and high‑risk shift‑based communities (healthcare, emergency response, essential workers)

Impact
By treating human wellbeing as a measurable resource, PulseGuard helps communities stay resilient, sustainable, and staffed.

One‑Liner
“We treat human wellbeing as a critical resource—measured, protected, and sustained by AI.”
